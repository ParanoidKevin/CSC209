When the client connects to the server, the server sends a greeting:
"dancecard", space, protocol version number (currently 1), CRLF.

Then the client must send the user's "handle", followed by CRLF.  The handle
must be 50 characters or fewer, and must not contain control characters.
It may not be "who", "begin", or "debug".

The server responds to the handle with a blank line (just CRLF) if the handle
is acceptable, or an error message if it is not (the error message will
usually be that another user already has this handle).  The error message is
suitable for display to the user.  If there is an error message, the server is
still expecting a handle.

Once the server responds with a blank line, the client says either 'l', 'f',
or 'b', and a CRLF.  This indicates whether the user dances lead, or follow,
or can dance both roles, respectively.  Again the server responds with either
a blank line or an error message, and loops in the latter case.

After this, all messages which the server sends are suitable for display to
the client.  The server begins each round by telling the users who is
available to dance.  At any time the client can send one of three possible
commands:
    * to ask someone to dance, send their handle.
    * to list those still available to dance, send "who"
    * to start this dance, send "begin"
Each of these commands is followed by a CRLF.
